# Rule-Based Python ChatBot 🤖

A simple Python chatbot that responds to user input using predefined rules and pattern matching — no machine learning or heavy NLP libraries required.

## Description

This project implements a rule-based chatbot in pure Python. The bot listens for user messages and replies based on a set of predefined patterns/responses. It’s a lightweight way to understand the basics of chatbot behavior and conversation flow.  

Ideal for learning fundamental chatbot design, experimenting with conversational rules, or building a foundation for more advanced bots.

## Features

- ✅ Pattern / keyword matching for user input.  
- ✅ Simple, deterministic responses (predictable and easy to extend).  
- ✅ Lightweight and dependency-free (or minimal dependencies) — works with basic Python.
